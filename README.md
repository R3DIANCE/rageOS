# rageOS
The ultimate open source rageMP GTA V multiplayer server

# why?
There are many Developers out there, developing cool resources for all kind of multiplayer servers for GTA V.
The goal of this project is to provide a place for all developers to contribute their sources to the community to build the most advanced, most exciting, most configurable rageMP server resource available.

# how?
This repository will be setup to hold the basic needs for the resources. It includes a well structured database schema which makes all thinkable scenarios of ingame features possible.
Contributers can provide pull requests with their fully documented sources to help build the server we have all dreamed of.

# rules
* All contributions have to be tested by the community
* All contributions must be fully documented (functions, entities, etc.)
* All contributions are licenced under the same licence as rageOS
